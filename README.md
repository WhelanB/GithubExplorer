# GitHubExplorer

An ASP.NET Core Web Application designed for Software Engineering which displays data based on the currently authorized user and eventually graphs Github-wide data
## Usage
Once authorised, the profile page will display private repositories and a pie chart of the languages used. The Graph page will display the languages you have in common with your followers, and allow you to view follower profiles.

##Dependencies
The project makes use of Octokit and Newtonsoft.JSON. It is built with ASP.NET Core and is therefore cross-platform

## Live Build
A live demo is available [here](http://gitterbug.azurewebsites.net). This is published to frequently and so may not always be stable. It is not always reflective of the current state of the repository, although will generally not be too far ahead of the previous development branch commit
